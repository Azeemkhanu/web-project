      <p class="tomb_sub_page_intro_para">Sultan Shahabuddin Mohammad Ghauri is a well know historical figure. Though Mohammad Bin Qasim and three centuries later, Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi had opened the gates of India to Muslims conquest, but they could not move permanently beyond present day Pakistan. The task of conquering the norther India finally fell upon Mohammad Ghauri.
      He was born in 1149 AD, in the Ghor region of Afghanistan, almost in the middle of Ghazni and Hera, an area of rugged mountains. His brother was a ruler of his region and soon they expanded their state at the expense of now declining Ghaznavi Empire. He first invaded Indiain 1175 and captured the city of Multan and in 1178 tried to invade Gujrat but faced a crushing defeat. However, in 1181 AD, he captured the important city of Lahore, the last stronghold of Ghaznavids. Now the path to northern India was open.</p>

    <p class="tomb_sub_page_History_para">In the year 1191 AD, he invaded India. Prithvi Raj Chauhan the ruler of Ajmer and Delhi met him at Tarain (modern name Taraori) a small town located at 29° 48' 08" N, 76° 55' 53" E in Haryana. As is known, he was defeated, but recovered remarkably and came again just a year later in 1192 AD, to cross his sword with Prithvi Raj. This time he inflicted a crushing defeat upon Prithvi and captured the city of Delhi and appointed Qutub ud Dina Aibak, as the governor. Hence, laid the foundation of Delhi Sultanate. With in a few years his general captured areas up to Bengal.
    A few years ago, Doctor Abdul Qadir Khan took personal interest and built a very beautiful tomb on his grave in 1994-95. It is a very beautiful and grand tomb, befitting a king like Ghauri. Its beautiful white building is located in open green fields of Potohar and is a great spectacle.
