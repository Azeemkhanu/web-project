    <p class="tomb_sub_page_History_para"> After joining his unit at Uri sector, Captain Sarwar Khan was appointed as the Company Commander. He led successful attacks on Indian army inflicting heavy damages to the enemy. On the fateful night of July 27, 1948, Captain Sarwar Khan launched an attack on the strongly fortified position of enemy at the Uri sector. Enemy responded with heavy machine gun and mortar fire but he and his men made their way through barbed wire barrier which was hindering their movement. In this process, Captain Muhammad Sarwar Khan received a burst of fire at his chest and embraced martyrdom.
    The body of Captain Sarwar is buried at the Hill of Tilpatra which is near the Uri in Indian Occupied Kashmir. On 23 March of 1956, the Government of Pakistan recognized his services awarded him the Nishan-E-Haider.
