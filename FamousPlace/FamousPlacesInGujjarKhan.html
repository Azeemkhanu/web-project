             <p class="tomb-sub-section-paragraph"> President Ayub Khan said here today [Oct 7] that construction of small dams would go a long way in improving agriculture and bringing new land under cultivation in ‘Barani’ areas.
             While inaugurating the 71-foot-high Dungi Dam two miles off Gujar Khan and 30 miles from Rawalpindi, the President expressed the hope that it will benefit the farmers of the surrounding area and thus help in the production of more foodgrains.
