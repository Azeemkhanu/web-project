      <p class="tomb_sub_page_intro_para">President Ayub Khan said here today [Oct 7] that construction of small dams would go a long way in improving agriculture and bringing new land under cultivation in ‘Barani’ areas.
        While inaugurating the 71-foot-high Dungi Dam two miles off Gujar Khan and 30 miles from Rawalpindi, the President expressed the hope that it will benefit the farmers of the surrounding area and thus help in the production of more foodgrains.

    <p class="tomb_sub_page_History_para">President Ayub said he was sure that the Dungi Dam, built at a cost of over Rs. 13 lakhs by the Agricultural Development Corporation, would add to the progress and prosperity of the land holders of the area. He advised the landlords owning land above 200 kanals to purchase tractors and take to mechanised farming.
      President Ayub inaugurated the Dungi Dam by unveiling a plaque and opening the sluice of the canal regulator. As soon as the President opened the sluice, water started flowing into the two and a half mile canal which would irrigate the ‘Barani’ land of the area.
