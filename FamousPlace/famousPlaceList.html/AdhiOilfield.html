      <p class="tomb_sub_page_intro_para">Adhi Field is a joint venture (JV) between PPL as operator, Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and Pakistan Oilfields Limited (POL), with working interest of 39, 50 and 11 percent, respectively. Field is located about 70 km south of Islamabad in the Pothwar region Gujar Khan.
      Exploration at Adhi began in 1956 and continued for a decade during which four wells were drilled. But all of them were abandoned due to insurmountable high pressure formation water inflows and subsurface complications.

    <p class="tomb_sub_page_History_para">In 1976, a seismic survey was carried out that led to the drilling of Adhi 5, a discovery well, in 1978, proving the presence of hydrocarbons.
    Crude oil production from the field commenced in early 1980’s from Sakesar reservoir. Other two reservoirs discovered were Tobra & Khewra bearing gas/ condensate. Adhi was declared a commercial discovery in June 1984. However, production from Sakesar was suspended in 1986 due to excessive water in produced crude. Subsequently, field was developed on Tobra/ Khewra reservoir and an LPG/ NGL plant (Adhi Plant-I) was installed and commissioned in January 1991. An early production facility was also installed between 2002 and 2003 to obtain production from Sakesar wells.
